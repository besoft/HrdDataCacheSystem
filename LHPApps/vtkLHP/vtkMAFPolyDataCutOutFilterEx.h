=========================================================================
vtkMAFPolyDataCutOutFilterEx cuts the input polydata surface
by the cut defined by the input polyline (see below) splitting
triangles affected by the cut into two polygons (which are
later triangulated). The connectivity between vertices of these
two polygons is severed (thus it is physical cut). By cutting,
the surface, therefore, splits into two parts (it is assumed
that the polyline is closed). One part (to the CutOutSide from the 
polyline) is discarded (cut out).

The filter has some strong assumptions on the input polyline:
1) polyline must be continuous (i.e., it must have just one 
component; it is one "contour" only) and closed
2) polyline edges must be oriented (i.e., for instance cells 
can be given as 01,12,23,30 but not 01,32,03,12 - which is
typical output from vtkCutter). The algorithm cuts out the part
of surface that lies to the left or right (see CutOutSide) from the polyline .
3) all points of polyline must lie on the input surface (within 
specified m_AbsCellTolerance and m_AbsPointTolerance tolerances)
4) two neighbouring points of the polyline (i.e., they form 
an edge) must lie in the same triangle of surface (i.e., on
the same plane)

Another assumption is that the input polydata contains of
triangles only and these triangles are consistently oriented.

Typical use of this filter is to cut out unwanted parts of 
surface that are identified by a polyline obtained from vtkCutter
based filters (beware that vtkCutter outputs violate 
assumptions 1 and 2) or filters for finding the shortest
path (in this case all conditions are usually fullfiled)


Changes
-------
29.10.2009 - the contour points must be either vertices of the mesh 
or they must lie on edges, SubdivideTriangle is no longer supported.
Contour is no longer checked, if it lies on the surface. It simply
must lie there and the closest points are picked. 

17.10.2011 - SubdivideTriangle reintroduced, the contour points may be 
distant (the path between these points is automatically constructed, so it can be cut)*/
